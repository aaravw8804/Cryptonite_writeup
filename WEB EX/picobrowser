for the picobrowser challenge we have to change the user agent 
this can be achieved by using network controls under inspection tab 

Some information on user agents ::
The user agent acts as a mediator between the user and the web server just like a human agent.
It processes the user's instructions, transfers them and receives the requested data. 
The user agent transmits information such as the browser version, installed plugins, and other data to the web server.
