So in vault door 3 challenge we recieved the altered form of password 
so all we had to do was apply the same loops to the altered passwords to get the original one 


def checkPassword(password):
    if (not len(password) == 32):
        return False
    buffer = [""]*32
    print(buffer)
    for i in range(8):
        buffer[i] = password[i]
    for i in range(8, 16):
        buffer[i] = password[23-i]
    for i in range(16, 32, 2):
        buffer[i] = password[46-i]
    for i in range(31, 16, -2):
        buffer[i] = password[i] 
    print(''.join(buffer))

checkPassword("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f")
